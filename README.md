I architect documentation systems that behave like scalable software — versioned, modular, executable, and intelligence-ready.  
My work lives at the intersection of engineering clarity, AI integration, and user-focused design.

> Currently open to: Remote Technical Writer / Docs-as-Code / Developer Documentation roles.

## Philosophy — Systems-First Documentation

- **Engineering mindset** – CI/CD, version control, and modularity from day one.  
- **AI-native authoring** – prompt packs, RAG-ready knowledge bases, automated extractors.  
- **Cross-domain fluency** – translating complexity in aerospace, fintech, biotech, and LLM tooling into clear guidance.
