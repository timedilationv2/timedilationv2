# Arsalan Khan

**Systems Architect | AI Automation Strategist | Senior Technical Writer**

I build modular execution systems—not passive codebases.  
Every repo here is an intelligent system engineered for real-world execution.

## 🔹 About Me

With 10+ years of experience across technical writing, system documentation, and creative storytelling, I specialize in translating complexity into clarity.

- **Documentation & UX:** DITA XML, Markdown, SOP transformation, UX-integrated flows  
- **Enterprise Experience:** Led automation and documentation pipelines at an Aviation/Aerospace firm (VIC) and a Fortune 500 company  
- **Execution Architect:** I design logic-first frameworks where docs, code, and systems are deeply integrated  
- **Creative Systems Thinking:** I merge documentation, AI automation, and execution logic into scalable architectures

## 🔹 GitHub Goals & Execution Strategy

I use GitHub not just to push code—but to document real execution pipelines.

- **YOLO** → Daily project commits  
- **Pull Shark** → PRs in open-source repos  
- **Galaxy Brain** → Strategic code reviews  
- **Arctic Vault** → Preserved open knowledge  
- **Pair Extraordinaire** → Collaborations and co-authored projects  

---

## 🔹 Philosophy

> **“Documentation is the interface. Clarity is execution.”**

If it doesn’t scale, it’s not finished.
