# Arsalan Khan

I build modular execution systems with a focus on terminal-first interfaces, backend automation, and structured documentation.

My work centers on clarity, repeatability, and performance—designed for environments where functionality matters more than presentation.

### Selected Projects
- [terminal-zero](https://github.com/timedilationv2/terminal-zero) — A terminal-native financial and news intelligence tool built with FastAPI, RSS, GPT, and market data feeds.
- [datacleaner-cli-sdk](https://github.com/timedilationv2/cli-plus-sdk-docs) — A CLI tool and Python SDK for cleaning and preprocessing CSV/JSON datasets in automation pipelines.
- [nadoxdocumentation](https://github.com/timedilationv2/nadoxdocumentation) — A documentation system using MkDocs for structured, versioned technical writing.
- [samplesite](https://github.com/timedilationv2/samplesite) — A static documentation framework, built for rapid deployment of docs and toolkits.

### Working Style
All codebases are active, evolving tools built to solve specific problems. No demos. No abstractions without purpose.
