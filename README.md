## Documentation Philosophy

My approach is simple: **treat documentation as a product**, not an afterthought. I build robust, docs-as-code pipelines that emphasize structure, reuse, and automation. This means delivering launch-ready outputs that are as reliable as the software they describe.

* **Engineering Mindset:** I build documentation with CI/CD, version control, and modularity baked in from day one.
* **AI-Native Authoring:** I construct agent-ready prompt packs, structured knowledge bases for RAG, and automated extraction tools.
* **Cross-Domain Fluency:** I translate complexity into clarity, whether it's for aerospace fault trees, biotech data ingestion, or LLM prompt systems.

## Human Layer

Beyond the code and docs, here's a bit about me.

* **üìç Location:** Seattle Metro (Lynnwood, WA). The Pacific Northwest is home.
* **üß† Currently Learning:** Advanced knowledge graph implementations and how they intersect with multi-agent AI systems.
* **ü§ñ Side Projects:** I'm always building something. Right now, I'm working on a "context pack generator" for LLMs and a "zero-to-docs" starter kit for early-stage tech startups.
* **‚òï Let's Connect:** I'm always open to talking about new technologies, complex documentation challenges, or startup ideas. Find me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timedilation/)** or **[X (Twitter)](https://x.com/timedilationv2)**.
