## Introduction

Hello and welcome! I’m **Arsalan A. Khan**, known online by the handle [@timedilationv2](https://github.com/timedilationv2). My work is dedicated to:

- Building **execution systems** that efficiently integrate **backend automation** and **structured documentation**.  
- Architecting developer-first tooling to empower software engineers with clarity and performance.  
- Delivering well-documented, extensible frameworks that scale across **infrastructure**, **APIs**, and beyond.

This repository serves as a comprehensive landing page for my projects, documentation, and ongoing experiments in the DevOps, data engineering, automation, and technical writing spaces.

## Background & Philosophy

### Hands-On Engineering Meets Systems-Level Vision
I started my journey as a **full-stack developer**, transitioning into **systems architecture** after recognizing the importance of robust, end-to-end solutions. Today, I focus on bridging the gap between design and implementation by creating consistent and detailed documentation for everything from **infrastructure** to **API references**.

### Developer-First Tooling
Tools should be **usable**, **accessible**, and **impactful**. I believe that no matter how powerful a tool is, its value is only realized if developers can integrate it seamlessly into their workflow. This is why I emphasize **developer experience** (DX), thorough documentation, and interactive examples.

### Automation & Clarity
Automation frees teams to focus on what really matters: **innovation**. I view automation not as a luxury but as a necessity in modern development environments. Combining that philosophy with the principle of **clarity**, I produce solutions that are both **efficient** and **easy to maintain**.

## Featured Projects

Here are some of my active, marquee projects. Each of these highlights a key area of my work, from command-line interfaces to structured documentation systems.

1. **[terminal-zero](https://github.com/timedilationv2/terminal-zero)**  
   A **terminal-based financial and market intelligence tool** leveraging:
   - **FastAPI** for microservice components  
   - **RSS & GPT** for real-time and generative insights  
   - **Live data feeds** for up-to-the-moment information  
   This project aims to integrate intelligent automation with user-friendly command-line experiences.

2. **[datacleaner-cli-sdk](https://github.com/timedilationv2/cli-plus-sdk-docs)**  
   A Python **CLI + SDK** suite for:
   - **Automated data cleaning** (missing values, formatting, duplicates)  
   - **Workflow automation** (scripts, pipeline orchestration)  
   - **Integration** with popular libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn  
   This tool provides a standardized approach to data wrangling, complete with comprehensive documentation.

3. **[nadoxdocumentation](https://github.com/timedilationv2/nadoxdocumentation)**  
   A **structured MkDocs documentation system** designed for:
   - **Technical writing pipelines**  
   - **Multi-repository** or **monorepo** architectures  
   - **Versioned or multi-lingual** documentation expansions  
   This project underscores the belief that consistent, easily navigable docs are essential for maintainable systems.

4. **[samplesite](https://github.com/timedilationv2/samplesite)**  
   A **static site framework** that focuses on:
   - Easy deployment to common platforms (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify)  
   - **Documentation-driven** site generation  
   - Minimal overhead, focusing on performance and content clarity  
   Built to explore frictionless ways to share knowledge and host interactive components.

## Repository Migration Status

> **Note:** This entire repo is under **active restructuring** as I consolidate multiple resources and codebases into modular packages.

- **Modular Packages**: Splitting monolithic code into self-contained modules for better maintainability.  
- **Generative AI Integration**: Enhancing data pipelines and developer tooling with GPT-based solutions.  
- **Improved Architecture**: Introducing standardized folder structures, versioned APIs, and Terraform-powered deployments across multiple cloud providers.  
- **Automation Workflows**: Building robust CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to expedite testing and deployments.

Expect frequent changes, refactoring, and reorganizations in the coming weeks as the migration proceeds. Stay tuned, and watch/star the repo to follow updates!

---

## Architecture & Approach

My approach to building **execution systems** rests on three core pillars:

1. **Infrastructure as Code**  
   - Leveraging **Terraform** for consistent provisioning across **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP**.  
   - Emphasizing maintainable, version-controlled infrastructure definitions.

2. **Microservices & Container Orchestration**  
   - Using **Docker** for containerizing services in development.  
   - Deploying to **Kubernetes** clusters for scalability and resilience.

3. **DevOps Tooling & CI/CD**  
   - Setting up **GitHub Actions** for automated builds, tests, and deployments.  
   - Ensuring zero-downtime releases through rolling updates and feature flags.

**Documentation Flow**  
- Adopting **Markdown** and **MkDocs** for light, readable, and easy-to-contribute documentation.  
- Encouraging a “docs-as-code” philosophy, with versioning and updates in lockstep with feature changes.
