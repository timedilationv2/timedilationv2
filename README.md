# Arsalan Khan

I design modular execution systems focused on functionality, automation, and efficiency.

My work emphasizes terminal-first interfaces, backend logic, and structured documentation.

### Current Projects
- [terminal-zero](https://github.com/timedilationv2/terminal-zero): Terminal-based financial and news data integration system using FastAPI, RSS, GPT, and market data APIs.
- [datacleaner-cli-sdk](https://github.com/timedilationv2/cli-plus-sdk-docs): Python CLI tool and SDK for efficient data cleaning, CSV/JSON preprocessing, and workflow automation.
- [nadoxdocumentation](https://github.com/timedilationv2/nadoxdocumentation): Structured documentation built on MkDocs, supporting technical writing and development workflows.
- [samplesite](https://github.com/timedilationv2/samplesite): Template for static sites and documentation, designed for rapid deployment and scalability.

### Approach
I develop tools as practical solutions to clearly defined problems. Each repository represents active, evolving workâ€”not demonstrations or theoretical concepts.
