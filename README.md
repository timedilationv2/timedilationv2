**Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** is a core discipline in prompt engineering that elevates the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This hub serves as a centralized, curated resource for developers and researchers dedicated to mastering this domain.

> The principle is simple: by instructing a model to "think step-by-step," we guide it to deconstruct complex problems, resulting in higher accuracy, enhanced transparency, and more reliable outputs. This repository archives the foundational knowledge and practical tools required to engineer these advanced reasoning workflows.

Our mission is to provide a clean, structured, and comprehensive collection of the most impactful resources in the CoT space.
