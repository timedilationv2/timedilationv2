# Arsalan A. Khan | @timedilationv2

**Systems Architect | Full-Stack Developer | Technical Writer**

I design execution systems that integrate backend automation, structured documentation, and developer-first tooling.

My background combines hands-on engineering with systems-level documentation. I build backend services, architect DevOps pipelines, and create documentation that scales—from infrastructure to API references.

Tools are only as valuable as they are usable. I work at the intersection of clarity, performance, and real-world deployment.
