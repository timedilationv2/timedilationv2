I architect documentation systems that behave like scalable software — versioned, modular, executable, and intelligence-ready.  
My work lives at the intersection of engineering clarity, AI integration, and user-focused design.

## Philosophy — Systems-First Documentation

- Engineering mindset – CI/CD, version control, and modularity from day one.  
- AI-native authoring – prompt packs, RAG-ready knowledge bases, automated extractors.  
- Cross-domain fluency – translating complexity in aerospace, fintech, biotech, and LLM tooling into clear guidance.
