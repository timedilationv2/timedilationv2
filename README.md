## About

I document how systems actually work.

My background spans aviation and power equipment, regulated financial operations, industrial projects, telecom services, and modern platform environments. Most of my work starts the same way: talk to the people doing the job, understand the real workflow, then turn that into something clear, repeatable, and usable.

I focus on procedures, operational guidance, and documentation that reduces guesswork — materials teams can rely on for training, onboarding, and day-to-day execution.
