**Systems Architect | AI Automation Strategist | Senior Technical Writer**

I build modular execution systems, not one-off projects.  
Every repo here is a functional engine—designed, documented, and deployed with clarity.

## About Me

With over a decade of experience in technical writing, UX design, and automation, I specialize in turning complexity into clarity—and clarity into systems that execute. My work includes:

- **10+ years in Technical Documentation:** SOP engineering, DITA-based docs, UX-integrated knowledge systems  
- **10+ years in Creative Writing:** Structured narratives, technical storytelling, clarity at scale  
- **AI, Automation, and CLI-first Systems:** I build real engines, from idea to interface  
- **Aviation/Aerospace + Fortune 500 Experience:** Converted thousands of SOPs into intelligent, automated pipelines.  
  *(Details limited due to confidentiality)*

Now, I lead the design of **Zleo AI**, a logic-first operating framework for automation, intelligence, and technical clarity.

## Core Philosophy

> **“Documentation is the interface. Clarity is execution.”**

If it can’t scale, it isn’t done.
