## About Me

With over a decade of experience in technical writing, UX design, and automation, I specialize in turning complex systems into clear, functional, and executable products. My work spans across:

- **Technical Documentation (10+ years):** From DITA XML to automated doc pipelines and compliance-driven SOP conversions.  
- **Creative & Strategic Writing (10+ years):** Storytelling fused with clarity, context, and structure.  
- **UX & Systems Design:** Interface-aware documentation, knowledge models, and scalable workflows.  
- **Automation + Execution Systems:** Python-based CLI tools, AI-integrated pipelines, and web intelligence engines.  

I’ve worked with companies like **VIC (Aviation/Aerospace)** and a **Fortune 500 enterprise** where I led the conversion of large volumes of SOPs into interactive, auto-updating systems. These projects required a hybrid skill set—**technical documentation analyst, automation strategist, and user-experience integrator.**  

Now, I’m focused on building **modular, scalable execution systems** under my unified architecture—**Zleo**.

## What I Actually Do

- Convert undocumented knowledge into clean, dynamic systems  
- Design AI-integrated automation pipelines for real-world use  
- Build tools that execute—never passive documentation  
- Write like an engineer, think like a strategist, and structure like a systems designer  
- Master interfaces: from documentation to command-line UX  
- Bridge chaos to clarity across cloud, AI, and code

## Core Philosophy

> **“Documentation is not an afterthought. It is the interface to execution.”**  
>  
> I build systems that explain themselves, scale with clarity, and leave no ambiguity between code and its consequence.
